# Python- This project was part of a work assignment. As a BI Analyst I was asked to provde the closest location of my company's nationwide network of store locations and determine the closest store location of a potential client. Eash list contained appoximately 2,000 locations. I determined the most accurate way to find this was to use a brute force calculation method in which I found the distance between every point on the list. For that method I would need to perform ~4,000,000 distance calculations.This was obvioiusly too much for a regular excel spreadsheet to handle , so I decided to use Python. In order to use this script both files will need to have a geolocation. This is the longitude and lattitude of the address. The client list did not have this information, but I was able find free online geoloaction services that took the addresses and converted them a geopoint. These are usually limited to ~2,500 per day, so if you list is longer than that you may have to pay for a service. Once both lists are ready you can run this script and it will use the haversine function to calculate the distance. I was surprised by how quickly python was able to do this calculation. To find the closest you will need to use the min function in excel.
